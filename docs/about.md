<div style="text-align: justify;">
LEPAM (Low-Energy Particles And Materials) is a toolkit to simulate the propagation of low-kinetic-energy electrons and holes through amorphous or crystalline materials using the Monte Carlo technique. The LEPAM package is developed using object-oriented programming in the C++ language and based on the <a href="https://root.cern"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">CERN ROOT</a> libraries.
